### Summary of challenges faced and lessons learned
I am personly familer with Linux and ubuntu but this Assignment has enriched and strength me more and more
the first parts were already known to me and there were known difficulties there 
but as I got deeper new things pubs up such as shell scripts that i had not done before or moving processes from Background and Foreground Processes

i have surfed the internet for info on some commands or how to alter  or manipulate processes, plus the YouTube video that you provided was very helpful it gives all the basic things that you can use to do much harder stuff.

now i  am more comfortable with ubuntu, learned about shell scripting
more understanding of how to control processes and much more.
